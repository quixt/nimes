    <h1>WE WILL STEAL YOUR DATA</h1>
    <p>Our company is a corrupt, dishonest institution run by an authoritatian megalomaniac who cares nothing for his customers.</p>
    <h3>Our data usage policy is as follows:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>We reserve the right to sell your information to foreign figures.</strong> We will take all information you submit and sell them to random countries and sketchy figures out there. We prioritize high-cybercrime countries as a first selling
            location.
        </li>
        <li><strong>We reserve the right to randomly turn your data over to the IRS and tell them that you are evading taxes.</strong> We will do this even if you are a tax-paying citizen.</li>
        <li><strong>We reserve the right to randomly charge purchases on your credit card.</strong> We will buy things the company needs but also random gadgets for the employees. Garry got a new Tesla last week. Who knows what we'll put on your card next!</li>
        <li><strong>We also like to play fast and loose with our return policy.</strong> If you try to return something, we will make up a reason why we can't take it back. We once told a customer that their item was " ineligible for return because it was
            used." We still have that item in the back.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>We hope you understand our data usage policy. If you do not, too bad. We will still steal your data.</p>
